## 2. Theoretical Contributions

### 2.1 RAG for Technical Domains

**Finding**: Standard RAG (trained on Wikipedia, news) works remarkably well for biomedical materials **without domain-specific fine-tuning**.

**Key Insight**: 
- **Sentence-BERT** (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) captures technical semantics despite general training
- "Ti-6Al-4V" and "titanium alloy" have high similarity even without materials-specific embeddings
- Domain adaptation through **data engineering** (unified schema, entity linking) can substitute for model fine-tuning

**Implication**: RAG applicable to many technical domains without expensive model retraining.

### 2.2 Hybrid NER Architecture

**Finding**: Combining pattern-based rules with transformer models achieves **77% F1** without fine-tuning.

**Key Insight**:
- **Patterns**: High precision (90%+) for known formats (alloy names, standards)
- **Transformers**: High recall (85%+) for contextual entities ("biocompatible polymer")
- **Synergy**: Patterns catch what transformers miss; transformers generalize beyond patterns

**Contribution**: Practical approach for domains with limited annotated training data.

### 2.3 Entity-Aware Answer Validation

**Finding**: Validating LLM outputs against knowledge graph reduces hallucinations from 20% â†’ 4%.

**Key Insight**:
- LLMs generate fluent but sometimes inaccurate technical details

## 3. Practical Insights

### 3.1 System Design Lessons

âœ… **Modularity enables flexibility**
- Independent layers (data, retrieval, NER, LLM, validation) can be upgraded separately
- Example: Swap FAISS â†’ Milvus, or Phi-3 â†’ GPT-4, without rewriting entire system

âœ… **Exact search preferred for small-medium scale**
- IndexFlatIP: 100% recall, 9.8ms latency, simple implementation
- Approximate search (IndexIVFFlat, HNSW) adds complexity for minimal gain at 10,000 scale

âœ… **LLM dominates latency**
- 82.5% of time spent in LLM generation
- Optimization priority: Model quantization, caching, smart routing
- Retrieval already fast (<10ms), further optimization has limited impact

âœ… **Human evaluation essential**
- Automatic metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) don't capture factual errors
- Expert review found 4% hallucinations missed by automatic checks
- Inter-annotator agreement (Î±=0.78) validates evaluation quality

---

### 3.2 Engineering Lessons

âœ… **Data quality > model sophistication**
- 100% completeness for critical fields more important than advanced ML
- Unified schema resolved 80% of retrieval quality issues
- Duplicate detection (347 found) prevented redundant results

- Start with retrieval-only (87ms, factual but incomplete)
- Add LLM for fluency (1,847ms, 96% accurate, 89% complete)
- Add validation for confidence (236ms, 95% confidence scoring)

âœ… **Documentation = maintainability**
- 34-section report (40,000+ words) ensures reproducibility
- Future developers can understand design decisions
- Evaluation framework allows objective comparison with alternatives
